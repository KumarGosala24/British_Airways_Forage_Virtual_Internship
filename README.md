During my virtual internship with British Airways, I successfully completed two tasks aimed at enhancing data analysis and predictive modeling capabilities.

Task 1:

Scraped review data from Skytrax, focusing on reviews about British Airways.
Utilized Python for data collection, emphasizing meticulous data cleaning for analysis readiness.
Employed techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds to extract insights.
Summarized findings concisely in a single PowerPoint slide, ready for board meeting presentation.

Task 2:

Explored dataset using provided Jupyter Notebook, understanding its structure and basic statistics.
Prepared dataset for predictive modeling, focusing on predicting customer bookings.
Engineered new features to enhance model performance.
Trained a machine learning model using RandomForest algorithm.
Conducted cross-validation and evaluation, assessing model performance and visualizing variable contributions.
Summarized key findings into a concise PowerPoint slide for managerial review.

Both tasks were executed proficiently, demonstrating my ability to extract meaningful insights from data and leverage advanced analytical techniques to drive strategic decision-making.
